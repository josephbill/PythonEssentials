# PYTHON IDENTIFIERS  (names we use to identify concepts)
# variables, functions , classes , modules , objects
# naming conventions in python.
# 1. When we create python classes , we will always start with a capital letter : Uppercase letters : e.g Emobilis1
# 2. If i start the naming of an identifier with an underscore , e.g. _Emobilis1 : I have given the identifier a private access
# 3. We can stress point two by having two underscores e.g __Emobilis1 : strongly private identifier
# 4. If I have two trailing Emobilis1__ : special named identifier.
# 5. any identifier without an underscore is public.

# PYTHON Has reserved words : these words should never be used as identifiers.
