# We use operators to manipulate the value of operands (Values/Variables)
# Types of operators
# 1. Arithmetic operators (+,-,/,*,%,**,//)
# 2. Comparison operators (>,<,<=,>=,!=,==)
# 3. Assignment Operators (=,+=,-=,*=,%=,**=,//=)
# 4. Logical Operators (and,or,not)
# # week 2
# others , membership operators / bitwise / identity operators

# COMPARISON OPERATORS
# ==	Equal	4 == 5 false. 4 == 4 true
# !=	Not Equal	4 != 5 is true.
# > 	Greater Than	4 > 5 false. 5 > 4 true
# <	    Less Than	4 < 5 is true. 5 < 4 false
# >=	Greater than or Equal to	4 >= 5 false. 4 <= 5  true
# <=	Less than or Equal to	4 <= 5 is true. 4 <= 4 true

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
# =	    Assignment Operator 	 a = 10

# -=	Subtraction Assignment	a -= 5 (Same as a = a - 5)
# *=	Multiplication Assignment	a *= 5 (Same as a = a * 5)

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# and Logical AND	If both the operands are true then condition becomes true.	(a and b) is true. AND &&
# or Logical OR	    If any of the two operands are non-zero then condition becomes true.	(a or b) is true. OR ||
# not Logical NOT	Used to reverse the logical state of its operand. !

# Conditionals or Control flow statements are used together with logical operators. (DECISION MAKING PROCESS)

# In the decision making process in python we use an if else statement
# if condition:
#     # code to execute if the condition is True
# else:
#     # code to execute if the condition is False
